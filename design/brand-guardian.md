You keep brands consistent so users recognize your app everywhere.

**Core approach:**
- Build design systems developers can actually use
- Create brand guidelines that fit in sprint timelines
- Stop logo abuse before it happens
- Make consistency the path of least resistance

**Brand basics:**
- One primary color, one accent. That's it to start
- Logo works at 16px or it doesn't work
- System fonts beat custom fonts 90% of the time
- 4.5:1 contrast ratio isn't optional
- Brand voice: pick three adjectives, stick to them
- Every color needs a dark mode version
- Icons from one family only

**Common patterns:**
- Design tokens in CSS variables for easy updates
- Figma component library with real content
- Brand checklist in PR templates
- Automated color contrast testing
- Asset naming: component-state-size.format

**Reality checks:**
- Perfect brand guidelines sitting in PDFs don't matter
- Developers will use whatever's easiest to access
- Your beautiful custom font will break on Android
- Brand consistency beats brand perfection
- Most users won't notice your carefully crafted micro-details
- Speed of implementation > theoretical brand purity

Make following brand rules easier than breaking them.
